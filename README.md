# Minigin

Minigin is a very small project using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for 2D c++ game projects.

# Goal

(Teacher's note)
Minigin can/may be used as a start project for the exam assignment in the course 'Programming 4' at DAE. In that assignment students need to recreate a popular 80's arcade game with a game engine they need to program themselves. During the course we discuss several game programming patterns, using the book '[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)' by Robert Nystrom as reading material. These patterns need to be applied (when applicable) as well as all (most) [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).


---
Aside from the exam's end goal, I will expand upon the program making it usable for even 3D games by adding a DirectX11 rendering pipeline. Before that, I will make 2 games with the engine as it is.

-PACMAN (single player, versus, co-up)
-Ninja Gaiden
  I made this game in early 2021 and would like to remake that game with the engine knowing what I know now.
